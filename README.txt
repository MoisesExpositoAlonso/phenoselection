# phenoselection
R scripts implementing phenotype selection gradients and coefficients of Lande & Arnold 1983

Linear gradients and coefficients are implementations of the equation 4 and 6c


Response to selection is the implementation of equation 6b in Arnold & Lande 1983


Quadratic coefficients and gradients are implementations of the equations 13b and 14a, respectively


Although it can be modified, in our equations we have a previous step of normalization of phenotypes, substracting mean and deviding by standard deviation, to allow comparisons across phenotypes and with other studies.
